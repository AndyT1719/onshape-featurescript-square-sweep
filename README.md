# Square Sweep Onshape FeatureScript

## Overview
This project makes a **square profile sweep** along a user defined path. The feature allows users to dictate square dimensions and sweep boolean operations.

## Feature Capabilities
- Square cross section sweep
- User defined sweep path with a partial sweep option
- Parametric square side length
- Automatic boolean options (add/remove/new/intersect)

## How to View the FeatureScript
The FeatureScript is in an Onshape Feature Studio

## Example Use Case
This feature can be used to model:
- Tubular frames
- Structural members
- Guide rails

## Motivation
I noticed I used a lot of sweeps with square cross sections a lot in my builds such as frames. Before I had to create a path, plane, sketch, and finally the sweep. I decided to learn how to code in Onshape's featurescript language so that I can use it to automate sweep creation which sped up modeling a lot for me. I also released this code to the public and it is used by over 100+ users acording to the linked doc statistic.
