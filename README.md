# Parametric Square Sweep — Onshape FeatureScript

## Overview
This project implements a custom Onshape FeatureScript that performs a **square-profile sweep** along a user-defined path. The feature is fully parametric and regenerable, allowing users to control square dimensions and sweep behavior.

## Feature Capabilities
- Square cross-section sweep
- User-defined sweep path
- Parametric square side length
- Robust regeneration with changing geometry
- Implemented entirely in Onshape FeatureScript

## How to View the FeatureScript
The FeatureScript is hosted in an Onshape Feature Studio.

## Example Use Case
This feature can be used to model:
- Tubular frames
- Structural members
- Guide rails
- Parametric mechanical components

## Technologies Used
- Onshape FeatureScript
- Parametric CAD modeling
- Geometric constraints and profiles

## Motivation
This project was developed to explore CAD feature automation and parametric geometry creation using FeatureScript, with emphasis on robustness and usability in mechanical design workflows.
